### Description
A simple RESTful API written in go that will return roll20 compliant DnD character sheets. 

My goals with this project are: 

    1. To create a functioning RESTful API that returns DnD character sheets
    
    2. To learn Go

### Usage

POST Body:

```

```

**NOTE**: Resources created with POST are not persisted. 

### Project Goals

* Accept Roll20 compliant character sheets
